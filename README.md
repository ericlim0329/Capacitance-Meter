# Capacitance-Meter
Created a capacitance meter that can measure capacitance and shows the error of the said capacitance to the measured capacitance.
The programming was done in 8051 assembly
The microcontroller used was an AMTEL AT89LP51IC2
A BO230XS serial USB Adaptor was used to interface with the laptop
An LCD 1602 module was used to display the numbers
A 22.1184MHZ crystal was used for the clock
